Regmex is a package for evaluation of motif rank correlation in a list of ranked DNA or RNA sequences.
It handles regular expressions for motif definition, and thus allows for evaluation of quite complex motifs.
Also it makes use of embedded Markov models to calculate accurate motif observation probabilities in sequences.
